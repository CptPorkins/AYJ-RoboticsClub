	  <p2>I will continue to use my computer science and programming knowledge to further improve my understanding of different programing languages. With theis knowledge I will also be able to improve my skill and make my code more complex and interesting. The aspects of this module that made the most significant impact on me as a student was learning how the manipulate arrays like 1D arrays, and 2D arrays. In using Daniel Shiffman's code and adding creative refactoring to it I was able to learn how to splice objects out of an array wich is very handy when it comes to making games with disapearing object or enemies.</p2>
