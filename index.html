	  <h1>Top 10 Programs I Coded Over The Semester</h1>
	  <p1>I am going to list the top 10 programs I made over the semester</p>

	  <h2>1. Space Invaders (Hackathon Project)</h2>

	  <p2>I will continue to use my computer science and programming knowledge to further improve my understanding of different programing languages. With this knowledge I will also be able to improve my skill and make my code more complex and interesting. The aspects of this module that made the most significant impact on me as a student was learning how the manipulate arrays like 1D arrays, and 2D arrays. In using Daniel Shiffman's code and adding creative refactoring to it I was able to learn how to splice objects out of an array wich is very handy when it comes to making games with disapearing object or enemies.</p2>

	  <h2>2. RGB Mixer (Hackathon Prep)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672244696961122327/Actualy_good_code.png">
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672255620560191488/unknown.png">
	  <p3>This code helped me learn a lot as a student. By working with friends on this code I learned how to manipulate RGB values, and how ot combine multiple RGB values to get a new color. The aspects of the module made the most significant impact on me as a student was learning how to put images into the html and making them appear on the webstie, I also learned a lot about RGB values and how computers view colors.</p3>
	  
	  <h2>3. Tribute Page (freeCodeCamp)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672259784434778122/unknown.png">
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672259932963209226/unknown.png">
	  <p4> <a href = "https://codepen.io/Dlyko/pen/mdyYJdP?editors=1100">Tribute Page </a> I will continue to use computer science to make websites similar to the tribute page and this webstie. The tribute page and this webssite tought me how to embed links into texts and images. The embeding of links in images and texts is the most important aspect of the code to me as a student because i learned how to do something new that alot of websites do.</p4>
	  
	  <h2>4. Project: Build-a-House (Intro to JS)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672263101302964242/unknown.png">
	  <p5>This code taught me about arrays before I did the Space Invaders code, I am going to use the knowledge from this code to help me make arrays later on when im coding more complex code. The most significant impact that this code had on me was learning how to design things on the screen using arrays. Later on in the course I took that knowledge of arrays and applied it to my Space Invaders code.</p5>
	  
	  <h2>5. Project: Fish-Tank (Intro to JS)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672267357602840576/unknown.png">
	  <p6>I will continue to use the knowledge of mouse clicking on my other programs. This code taught me how to make objects appear on screen when the mouse button is clicked. The aspect of this module that had the most significant impact was making things happen when the mouse button is clicked.</p6>
	  
	  <h2>6. Project: Event invite (Intro to HTML/CSS)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672272057404227585/unknown.png">
	  <p7>I will continue to learn more about the knowlledge taught iin this code. This code taught me how to make margins for a "letter" and how to manipulate the HTML text using CSS. The most significant aspect of this module that had the most impact on me as a student was the text font and color manipulation, I can apply this knowledge when making other websties, I used this when I made my tribute page project.</p7>
	  
	  <h2>7. Project: Paint splatter (Advanced JS:Natural Simulations)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672275799948263434/unknown.png">
	  <p8>I will continue to use randow generators in my code to make random enemies spawn or random chance of something happening in a game. The random generating was the most important aspect of the code. It teaches you how to get random values that you can now apply to anything in your code.</p8>.
	  
	  <h2>8. Project: Recursive art (Algorithms)</h2>
	  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672242997345124356/672278116068098058/unknown.png">
	  <p9>As a student I will continue to use the things I learned from this code in my future projects. The most important aspect of this module is also the randomness and making shapes change.</p9>
