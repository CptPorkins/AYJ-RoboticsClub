	  <p2>I will continue to use my computer science and programming knowledge to further improve my understanding of different programing languages. With theis knowledge I will also be able to improve my skill and make my code more complex and interesting. The aspects of this module that made the most significant impact on me as a student was learning how the manipulate arrays like 1D arrays, and 2D arrays. In using Daniel Shiffman's code and adding creative refactoring to it I was able to learn how to splice objects out of an array wich is very handy when it comes to making games with disapearing object or enemies.</p2>

	  <h3>RGB Mixer (Hackathon Prep)</h3>

	  <p3>This code helped me learn a lot as a student. By working with friends on this code I learned how to manipulate RGB values, and how ot combine multiple RGB values to get a new color. The aspects of the module made the most significant impact on me as a student was learning how to put images into the html and making them appear on the webstie, I also learned a lot about RGB values and how computers view colors.</p3>

	  <p4> <a href = "https://codepen.io/Dlyko/pen/mdyYJdP?editors=1100">Tribute Page </a> I will continue to use computer science to make websites similar to the tribute page and this webstie. The tribute page and this webssite tought me how to embed links into texts and images. The embeding of links in images and texts is the most important aspect of the code to me as a student because i learned how to do something new that alot of websites do.</p4>
